Sphinx AutoAPI
==============

Sphinx AutoAPI is a Sphinx extension for generating complete API documentation
without needing to load, run, or import the project being documented.

In contrast to the traditional `Sphinx autodoc <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`_,
which requires some manual authoring and uses code imports,
AutoAPI finds and generates documentation by parsing source code.
